                <p>Following her collaboration with the artist Dextro on the influential 1997 project Turux.org, LIA
                    developed her solo series <em>re-move</em> as a continuation and deepening of her exploration.
                    While Turux.org had introduced her to creating interactive audiovisual compositions using Macromedia
                    Director, re-move became a more personal and conceptually refined project. Macromedia Director was a
                    popular tool among web designers at the time. Marketed with the slogan “Add life to the web!” LIA’s
                    work indeed did so, but through a distinctly artistic lens—her compositions balanced soft, organic
                    forms with geometric precision and a minimal color palette, achieving an aesthetic both restrained
                    and alive. Her work became part of the forefront of what would later be known as generative art.</p>
                <p> RE-move, emphasizes discovery and experimentation through interaction. Each of the ten pieces in the
                    series features sets of enigmatic, unlabeled icons that allow users to alter various parameters of
                    the artwork. Without any instructions or explanations, participants are encouraged to explore
                    through trial and error, learning how their actions affect the composition. This process mirrors
                    LIA’s own intuitive approach to coding and design—an open-ended dialogue between human intention,
                    algorithmic logic, and chance. The user can never fully control the system; rather, they collaborate
                    with it, participating in a shared process of creation.

                <p>LIA also extended the generative philosophy into the physical design of the work’s limited-edition
                    CD-ROM release. Each CD was enclosed in a hand-sewn plastic cover filled with fragrant orange
                    blossoms and a floating transparent film bearing the project’s title. The shifting position of these
                    elements ensured that every package was unique, reflecting the unpredictability and individuality of
                    the digital works themselves. The CD-ROM’s 800×600 resolution, typical of late-1990s multimedia
                    design, was chosen deliberately to preserve the intimate scale and clarity of the visuals. Over
                    time, some pieces in re-move became technically fragile. Certain compositions depended on specific
                    software behaviors—such as glitches within Director—that could not be exactly reproduced in newer
                    environments. Recognizing this, LIA undertook a careful digital preservation effort, rebuilding the
                    entire series in p5.js while maintaining its original resolution and feel. This act not only
                    preserved accessibility but also highlighted the time-specific nature of early digital art, where
                    code, aesthetics, and technology were inseparable.
                </p>
                <p>Re-move represents a pivotal moment in LIA’s career and in the history of digital art. It bridges
                    early web-based experimentation with a mature investigation of interaction, system-based creativity,
                    and the aesthetics of code—showcasing not what machines are supposed to be, but what they could be.

                <p class="quote">“This is the larger ideological importance of software-driven abstraction–at its best
                    it quite accurately and at the same time poetically captures our new image of a world seen as the
                    dynamic networks of relations, oscillating between order and disorder, always vulnerable and ready
                    to change with a single click of the user.”</p>
