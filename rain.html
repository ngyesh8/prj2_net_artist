                <p> <em>Rain</em> by LIA in collaboration with engineer Damian Stewart, is “an abstract artistic
                    interpretation of
                    raindrops falling on a window pane” and explores the natural phenomenon “of patterns emerging from
                    the random forms created when rain falls onto a window.” The software-based system generates
                    continuously changing visual output: one version is an interactive box (with five custom-made slider
                    knobs and two buttons) where viewers can tweak parameters of the generative algorithm; another
                    version is a projection of the software autonomously moving through parameter states; a third is a
                    series of digital prints capturing selected “moments” of the algorithmic output.</p>
                <p>The media box was made from cherrywood and aluminium, and it embeds a low-powered computer running
                    Linux that requires little to no maintenance. This hardware design raises questions about how
                    software-based art should present itself—aesthetic, convenient, user-friendly. Stewart comments that
                    collectors don’t want to buy “a computer” and face upgrade/maintenance issues; they would rather
                    collect “objects that ‘just work’.”</p>
                <p>This piece invites viewers into an active role as parameter-changers rather than passive observers,
                    shifting the dynamic of art consumption: you aren’t just watching rain patterns, but directly
                    manipulating them via the sliders, which underscores a broader trend in interactive and new-media
                    art. The hardware design also signals a maturation of software art towards collectors and potential
                    users as well-designed objects of interest rather than utilitarian screen-based installations. The
                    fact that the work is available in editions, prints, and physical boxes highlights how generative
                    art is being folded into the commercial/collecting art world.</p>
